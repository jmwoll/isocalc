With isocalc, isotopic patterns can be calculated
from python:
```
from isocalc import isocalc
isocalc.plot_isotope_distribution("C1")
```
will result in the following plot:

While the following code:
```
from isocalc import isocalc
isocalc.plot_isotope_distribution("C1Br4")
```
will result in the following plot with several isotopic peaks:
